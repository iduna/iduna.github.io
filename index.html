				<h2>Rationale</h2>
				<p>The modern concepts of personalized medicine or prevention developed from molecular biology, specifically from human genome studies. The old medical systems, for example, Traditional Chinese Medicine, look human body holistically. However, the Chinese medicine treatments are highly individualized. That is because molecules affect function of the human body they reside in. Even slight difference of genes they carry causes people react to environmental factors differently. Consequently, People need different solutions to keep them healthy. Old medical systems observed and coped with reactions caused by the difference of genes. Therefore, there is much to be adopted from alternative medicine.</p>
